# Nova
### maybe the most ambiguous program ever

**Nova** is a program with a compilation of features and... stuff.

This program is mainly here for me to practice programming in Java and C++, working with git, and just play around with GitHub.

I'm don't know how to package this to make it run as a standalone program, if you want to try it, pull it and run it in something Visual Studio or something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Feel free to fork this, add whatever you'd like, or simply make suggestions.
